# Background  
As someone who's passionately involved in the local Tekken 7 (fighting game) scene, i had the luxury to meet content creators like Keith who put out video tutorials and guides on Youtube for teaching and sharing their love of the game.   
Part of the video editing process requires them to manually stitch up unique strings of inputs to perform a set of moves back-to-back called combos that are unique from one character to another, with seemingly endless potential combinations. The process is arduous and often frowned upon by other creators as it takes a lot of time to do them and can drastically slow down production.

# Development
As a passion project i started to create this tool **Tekinput Generator**, short-hand for "Tekken Input Generator" that aims to solve this problem. 
What started out as a week long project to prototype this tool to personally help my friend solve this issue made me realize there's a ton of people that can benefit from it.
That's why i decided to continue to improve and eventually shared it with others with critical reception. 

Tekinput Generator is programmed on Python Programming language using the TkInter Library and SQLite as a Database for the variety of moves available. With a few simple clicks, one can stitch up all the images and produce the final image easily and visually saving creators hundreds of hours. Whats more it is technically modifiable to allow you to use it for ANY other games that might need the functionality.

Thanks to keith for making a tutorial and teaching everyone how to use it!
