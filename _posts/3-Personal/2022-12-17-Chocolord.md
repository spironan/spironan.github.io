Chocolord is a simulation game where players gets to experience the various steps of the process from creating their own chocolate to serving customers their unique request. Chocolord was developed on Unity for android devices over the period of 8 months by indie startup from me and my friend. The game was featured in Tapei Game Show in 2019.

# Development

Chocolord came to be from me and my friend who took on a journey to continuously iterated on various game ideas over a month and landed on it after a few others.
It started as an extremely simple game developed in just a week but we found there was potential in the series and wanted to see how far we can push it.
This meant that we started to go beyond just development, reaching into unexplored territory of finding and outsourcing our audio and art for the game, finding publishers or events to get funds for the game and even creating our own startup studio tl;dr studios, creating social media pages like facebook and engaging video game communities in Singapore to promote our game. Eventually beta launching our game on google play store and securing a fully sponsored trip to taipei game show to showcase our games to the public audience in 2019. 

As a programmer I got to interact and integrate with many new APIs like firebase, google play store and other libraries to help build continuous support for the game on Android devices of all sizes and have the opportunity to learn a lot more on how to customize Unity deeper to suit our development needs. 

While the game never got to launched fully it was an important journey and experience to me as i've got to learn so much of what goes into developing a video game and the many aspects one has to be concerned over in developing and launching a successful video game.
