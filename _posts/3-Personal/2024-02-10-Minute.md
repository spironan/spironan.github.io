Developed alongside our custom game engine `Ouroboros 2`, `Minute` is the end product that I spearheaded.

This project was born out of a yearlong endeavor that transcended typical academic requirements. As a project manager and the driving force behind **Minute**, I rallied a team of talented individuals, united by a shared vision to create something extraordinary.

## My Role and Contributions

Leading a team of 11, I navigated the complexities of game development, from ideation to publication. My responsibilities included:

- **Visionary Leadership**: Crafting the roadmap, setting milestones, and identifying potential challenges to keep the project on track and the team motivated.
- **Project Coordination**: Managing a balance between ambition and feasibility, ensuring that we remained focused on our goals while adapting to obstacles.
- **Industry Liaison**: Spearheading the initiative to get Minute published on Steam and DigiPen Games Gallery, including negotiating the rigorous review processes and ensuring our game met the high standards required for public release.

Beyond project management, i was also an individual contributor as a lead engine architect. More information can be found on the Ouroboros 2 custom engine post.

## Challenges and Triumphs

Bringing **Minute** to life was a journey filled with challenges, learning experiences, and ultimately, triumphs. From coordinating with DigiPen's publishing studio to navigating the intricacies of game development standards, every step taught me the value of persistence, teamwork, and innovation.

The development of "Minute: A Tinker's Tale" and its subsequent publishing defied the odds. Creating such an ambitious game on a custom engine seemed like an insurmountable task in the face of today's dominant game engines. I am well aware of the vast gap that stood between us and industry giants.

However, drawing from the invaluable lessons of previous projects and the expertise I gained, I directed my team to focused on what truly mattered. We utilized our knowledge and pushed ourselves beyond limits, ultimately making the game work against these extraordinary odds.
