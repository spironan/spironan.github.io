Trident War is a 2 week international game project taking place in japan September 2017. This was a very interesting experience and as i got to work with 3 Japanese students, 1 of which artist and the 2 other programmers and an Australian masters student specialized in sound design. Our game won the "industry choice" award.

# Development
During this weeks, we faced many challenges as a team due to communication barriers and getting everyone on the right track. The theme of the competition was Artificial Intelligence and we thought of creating a very simple game based on rock paper scissors.

I actively played a role of guiding everyone in the team design choices and bringing everyone ideas together for discussions, i was also in charge of the game User interface and sound systems together with many iterations of user experience re-design to best fit the buttons for the players ease of use.

the game was later chosen by a representative from nippon ichi software, a Japanese game distributor and developer company. I was very elated to hear that the game won the prize due to its high level of polish and thought put into the game together with its simple and easy look and feel!
