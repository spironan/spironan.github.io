# About
Arbitrium is a Final Year Project Consisting of 5 team members that developed over the course of 4 months with an ambitious goal to make a hyper-realistic immersive experience using the than emerging Cutting Edge Virtual-Reality headsets.  

# Contributions

I was the Project Manager which coordinated and made important decisions for us to produce a complete product within the time frame and continued to push boundaries by coordinating with external classes to help facilitate and enhance the game with motion capture and sound recordings.  

As the Lead Gameplay Programmer, i made full use of UE4 to ensure the movement felt good, created EMP shockwave mechanic using unreal particles system and spline technology to create zipline and climbing for players to interact with the world.

<!-- We had the opportunity to present this game to many clients and ministers to highlight the strength of our course and what could be the future.

Overall i had put in a lot of effort to quickly understand and grasp multiple new concepts, pushing my boundaries of learning and executing everything together with my team as one. Picking up important skills to rally teammates and have good planning and foresight to manage the various aspects to its best abilities. -->
