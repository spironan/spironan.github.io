Ouroboros is the game engine created to power my 2 trimester long project in University during my sophomore year(2nd year).
The game engine was built from the ground up in collaboration with 4 other programmers.

# Contributions
My main role for the team was the overall Producer and as a lead engine architect. All while creating a fully powered 2D Physics engine from scratch.  
The engine is entirely written in C++ and I provided the initial foundation of the engine including the core game loop, window interfaces, keyboard and controller input capturing using SDL library and more.

The 2D Physics Engine it was fully written from scratch boasting support for movement dynamics such as gravity, friction and air resistance, collision detection between various shapes including any convex shapes using fast and efficient separating-axis theorem(SAT) and GJK. Accurate Collision Resolution using impulse solvers. It was a robust physics engine that supports singular contact point resolutions with fixed update rate that supports in-game behaviourial scriptable responses ("triggers") as well as separation of layers for further optimization and usability.

# Engine Trailer
Below is the final product our of game engine after 8 months of work
